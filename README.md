## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

In SIMbiosis, you explore a sandbox ecosystem where multiple "assemblages" — components that represent systems such as water tanks, solar panels, or human agents — interact dynamically over time.

Each component has:
- Inputs and outputs (e.g., water, energy, heat)
- Internal state (e.g., capacity, decay rate)
- Behavior rules (e.g., when full, when needs are unmet)
- Interconnections to other components (pipes, wires, etc.)

Your role is to **observe, adjust, and experiment**:
- Watch how the system evolves
- Test how changes ripple through the system
- Discover emergent patterns from simple rules
